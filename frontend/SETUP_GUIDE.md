npm run dev
```

The application will be available at: http://localhost:3000

### Step 3: Test the Application

1. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Fill in the energy consumption form with your data
3. Click "Calculate My Carbon Footprint"
4. View your personalized analysis and recommendations

## üìã Form Fields Explained

  - Summer: 8-12 hours/day
  - Winter: 0-2 hours/day

- **Number of Refrigerators**: Count all fridges/freezers
  - Most homes: 1-2 units

- **Heating (hours/day)**: Heating system runtime
  - Winter: 4-8 hours/day
  - Summer: 0 hours/day

### Lighting
- **Lighting Hours per Day**: Average daily usage
  - Typical: 5-8 hours/day

- **Using LED Bulbs**: Check if you use energy-efficient LEDs
  - LEDs use 75% less energy than incandescent

### Water & Laundry
- **Washing Machine (loads/week)**: Laundry frequency
  - Average family: 4-7 loads/week

- **Dishwasher (loads/week)**: Dish cleaning frequency
  - Average family: 3-5 loads/week

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Customize Carbon Factors

Edit `components/EnergyForm.tsx` to adjust emission factors for your region:

```typescript
const electricityFactor = 0.5 // kg CO2 per kWh (US average)
const gasFactor = 8.89 // kg CO2 per gallon
```

### Customize Colors

Edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: {
        // Your custom color palette
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## üìä Understanding Results

### Total Footprint
- **Below 16 tons**: Better than US average! üéâ
- **16-20 tons**: Around average
- **Above 20 tons**: Room for improvement

### Carbon Offset
- Trees shown = number needed to neutralize emissions
- 1 tree absorbs ~60kg CO‚ÇÇ/year (0.06 tons)
- Consider planting or supporting reforestation

### Potential Savings
- Shows maximum achievable reduction
- Implement high-impact actions first
- Track progress over time

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```powershell
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

### Dependencies Issues
```powershell
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -r node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Build Errors
```powershell
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -r .next
npm run build
```

## üö¢ Deployment

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```powershell
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: Docker
```powershell
docker build -t ecoai-frontend .
docker run -p 3000:3000 ecoai-frontend
```

### Option 3: Build & Host Manually
```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

## üì± Mobile Testing

The app is fully responsive. Test on different devices:
- Desktop: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
- Tablet: iPad, Android tablets
- Mobile: iOS Safari, Chrome Android

## üîó API Integration

To connect with the backend API:

1. Ensure backend is running on port 3001
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.local`
3. Uncomment API call in `EnergyForm.tsx`:

```typescript
const response = await axios.post(
  `${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/analyze`,
  data
)
setAnalysisResult(response.data)
```

## üìà Next Steps

1. **Test the calculator** with different scenarios
2. **Share with friends** to get feedback
3. **Customize** colors and branding
4. **Connect** to the AI backend for enhanced analysis
5. **Deploy** to production when ready
